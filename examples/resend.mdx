<Tip>
  Resend.com is currently in private beta but you can request early access

### Example workflows:

## Welcome email drip campaign

This workflow will get triggered and a Slack notification and welcome email will be sent straight away.
1 day later we check if the user has completed onboarding, if they have, they get a 'tips' email, otherwise they get a re-engagement email.

Integrations required: Resend, Slack
