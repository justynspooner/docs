If you'd like to add additional logging to your workflow run, you can use our built-in logging utility

## Usage

```ts
import { Trigger } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";

new Trigger({
  id: "my-trigger",
  on: scheduleEvent({ rateOf: { minutes: 5 } }),
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    await ctx.logger.info("It's been 5 minutes since the last run!");
  },
}).listen();
```

This will log the message to your workflow run page in the Trigger dashboard

There are 4 different types of logs you can add as workflow steps:

```ts
await ctx.logger.info("It's been 5 minutes since the last run!");
await ctx.logger.debug("This is a debug log");
await ctx.logger.warn("This is a warning");
await ctx.logger.error("This is an error");
```

You can also include a second argument to the logger to add additional metadata to the log:

```ts
await ctx.logger.info("It's been 5 minutes since the last run!", {
  foo: "bar",
  baz: 123,
});
```
