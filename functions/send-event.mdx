To trigger your custom event workflows, you'll need to send an event to our API. You can do this via our `@trigger.dev/sdk` package or via our HTTP API.

## Sending events via `@trigger.dev/sdk`

If you are using our Node.js SDK, you can send events via the `sendEvent` function, like so:

```ts
import { sendEvent } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { randomUUID } from "node:crypto";

//send an event with the name "user.created"
//and the payload
await sendEvent(randomUUID(), {
  name: "user.created",
  payload: { userId: "123456" },
});
```

The first parameter is a unique ID for the event. This is used to deduplicate events, so if you send the same event twice, the second event will be ignored. You can use the `randomUUID` function from Node.js to generate a unique ID.

The second parameter is the event itself. It must have a `name` and a `payload` property. The `name` is the name of the event you want to trigger, and the `payload` is the data you want to send as the event in the `Trigger.run` function.

### API Key

It's not accepted as a parameter, but the `sendEvent` function will automatically use the `TRIGGER_API_KEY` environment variable as the API key. The API key determines which environment will receive the event. If you want to send events to a different environment, you can set the `TRIGGER_API_KEY` environment variable to the API key of the environment you want to send events to. See our [Environments & API Keys Guide](/guides/environments) for more info.

### Sending events as a step in a workflow

You can also send events as a step in a workflow, by calling `sendEvent` inside the `Trigger.run` function, like so:

```ts
import { Trigger, scheduleEvent, sendEvent } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";

new Trigger({
  id: "check-scheduler",
  name: "Check Scheduler",
  on: scheduleEvent({ rateOf: { minutes: 10 } }),
  run: async (event, context) => {
    await sendEvent("send-event", {
      name: "health.check",
      payload: {
        url: "https://trigger.dev",
        host: "trigger.dev",
      },
    });
  },
}).listen();
```

Notice that the first parameter is no longer the event ID, but rather the `key`. The key is a string that is unique across all actions in the workflow run. See our [Keys and Resumability Guide](/guides/resumability) for more info.

<Info>In this case we will automatically generate an Event ID for you.</Info>

The API key will be automatically set to the API key of the environment that the workflow is running in.

## Sending events via HTTP API

You can also send events via our HTTP API. We have comprehensive documentation for the `events` endpoint [here](/api-reference/events/sendEvent), but here are some examples in various languages:

<Snippet file="send-event-code-samples.mdx" />

Notice that the API key is set in the `Authorization` header, which will determine which environment will receive the event. If you want to send events to a different environment, you can set the `Authorization` header to the API key of the environment you want to send events to. See our [Environments & API Keys Guide](/guides/environments) for more info.

## Delaying event delivery

Through both our Node.js SDK and our HTTP API, you can delay the delivery of an event. This is useful if you want to send an event to trigger a workflow, but you want to wait for a certain amount of time before the event is delivered.

Using the health check example above, we can delay the delivery of the `health.check` event in various ways:

```ts
new Trigger({
  id: "check-scheduler",
  name: "Check Scheduler",
  on: scheduleEvent({ rateOf: { minutes: 10 } }),
  run: async (event, context) => {
    await sendEvent("health.check trigger.dev", {
      name: "health.check",
      payload: {
        url: "https://trigger.dev",
        host: "trigger.dev",
      },
      delay: { until: new Date(Date.now() + 1000 * 60 * 5) }, // Delay until a specific date
    });

    await sendEvent("health.check docs.trigger.dev", {
      name: "health.check",
      payload: {
        url: "https://docs.trigger.dev",
        host: "docs.trigger.dev",
      },
      delay: { minutes: 5 }, // Delay for a specific amount of time
    });

    await sendEvent("health.check app.trigger.dev", {
      name: "health.check",
      payload: {
        url: "https://app.trigger.dev/healthcheck",
        host: "app.trigger.dev",
      },
      delay: { seconds: 30 }, // Delay for a specific amount of time
    });
  },
}).listen();
```

<Note>
  When sending events in the context of a workflow run, adding a delay DOES NOT
  add a delay to the workflow run, as sending a custom event is a
  fire-and-forget action.
</Note>

You can add delays via the HTTP API by adding a `delay` object to the event:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://app.trigger.dev/api/v1/events \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <insert_api_key_here>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
            "id": "<unique event id>",
            "event": {
              "name": "user.created",
              "payload": {
                "userId": "123456"
              },
              "delay": {
                "seconds": 30
              }
            }
          }'
```
