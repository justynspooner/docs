## Usage

A `runOnce` function is available to use inside a `Trigger.run` function through the `context` argument, allowing you to run a callback function only once [\*](#caveats) per run, based on the key you provide. This makes it so you can write code that participates in the Trigger.dev resumability system, even if your server is restarted.

<Note>
  Please see our detailed [Keys and Resumability guide](/guides/resumability)
  for more information on how Trigger.dev handles resumability.
</Note>

```ts
import { Trigger } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";

new Trigger({
  id: "run-once-example",
  name: "Run Once Example",
  on: customEvent({
    name: "example.runOnce",
  }),
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    await ctx.runOnce("Example Key", async (idempotencyKey) =>
      performIdempotentAction(idempotencyKey)
    );
  },
}).listen();
```

The `performIdempotentAction` above is only called once [\*](#caveats) per run, even if the server is restarted. The `idempotencyKey` is a unique key that is generated for each run, and is used to ensure that the action is only performed once per run.

<Info>
  The Stripe API is a great example of an API that uses idempotency keys to
  ensure that an action is only performed once. You can read more about it in
  their [Idempotent Requests
  docs](https://stripe.com/docs/api/idempotent_requests)
</Info>

Your callback can also optionally return a value, and that value will be returned from the `runOnce` function.

```ts
import { Trigger } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";

new Trigger({
  id: "run-once-example",
  name: "Run Once Example",
  on: customEvent({
    name: "example.runOnce",
  }),
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    const output = await ctx.runOnce("Example Key", async (idempotencyKey) =>
      performIdempotentAction(idempotencyKey)
    );

    // Do something with the output
    // ...
  },
}).listen();
```

In your app.trigger.dev run dashboard we will also display the output of your `runOnce` function, so you can see what it returned easily:

## Caveats

As you may have noticed above, we've used cleverly placed asterisks above to signal that your callback passed to the `runOnce` function MAY actually be called more than once, in certain situations.

It's possible that in between us running the `runOnce` callback and attempting to send the result to trigger.dev, an issue occurs and we are unable to save the result. If this happens, and we [resume](/guides/resumability) the same run at a later time, your callback function will be called again (but with the same idempotency key).

This is why it's important that your callback function is truly idempotent. If you're not sure what that means, we recommend reading the [Stripe docs on idempotent requests](https://stripe.com/docs/api/idempotent_requests).

## Local Only

If you don't want to send the result of the `runOnce` callback to trigger.dev, you can alternatively use the `runOnceLocalOnly` function. This is useful if you want to use the `runOnce` functionality, but don't want to store the value in the Trigger.dev database.

<Warning>
  `runOnceLocalOnly` will ALWAYS call your callback function, so be extra sure
  your callback is truly idempotent. See below for more information.
</Warning>

```ts
import { Trigger } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";

new Trigger({
  id: "run-once-local-only-example",
  name: "Run Once Local Only Example",
  on: customEvent({
    name: "example.runOnce",
  }),
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    const output = await ctx.runOnceLocalOnly(
      "Example Key",
      async (idempotencyKey) => performIdempotentAction(idempotencyKey)
    );

    // Do something with the output
    // ...
  },
}).listen();
```

## Real World Example

Let's say you want to use the Stripe SDK to make an idempotent charge to a customer using trigger.dev. You can use the `runOnce` function to generate an `idempotencyKey` and pass it to the Stripe SDK, ensuring that the charge is only made once per run.

```ts
import { Trigger } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import Stripe from "stripe";
import z from "zod";

const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, {
  apiVersion: "2020-08-27",
});

new Trigger({
  id: "stripe-charge",
  name: "Stripe Charge",
  on: customEvent({
    name: "example.stripeCharge",
    schema: z.object({
      orderId: z.string(),
      customerId: z.string(),
      amount: z.number(),
    }),
  }),
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    const { customerId, amount, orderId } = event.data;

    const stripeResponse = await ctx.runOnce(
      orderId,
      async (idempotencyKey) => {
        return await stripe.charges.create(
          {
            amount,
            currency: "usd",
            customer: customerId,
          },
          {
            idempotencyKey,
          }
        );
      }
    );

    return stripeResponse;
  },
}).listen();
```
