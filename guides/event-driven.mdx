## Event-driven Patterns in Trigger.dev

### Claim check pattern

Inspired by [this post](https://serverlessland.com/event-driven-architecture/visuals/claim-check-pattern) by [@boyney123](https://twitter.com/boyney123), here is how you could implement the claim check pattern using Trigger.dev:

```ts
import { Trigger } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import * as github from "@trigger.dev/github";
import { db } from "./db.server";

new Trigger({
  id: "issue-producer",
  on: github.events.issueEvent({
    repo: "triggerdotdev/trigger.dev",
  }),
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    // 1. Store the event in a database (e.g. MongoDB, DynamoDB, etc.)
    const id = await db.insert(ctx.id, event);

    // 2. Send a new event with the id of the stored event
    await ctx.sendEvent("ðŸ“§ Send Event", {
      name: "github.issue",
      payload: {
        id,
        action: event.payload.action,
      },
    });
  },
}).listen();
```

The above workflow will store any issue events from the trigger.dev repo in a database. Then, it will send a new event with the name `github.issue` and the id and action of the stored event. This event can then trigger another workflow and be used to retrieve the original event from the database:

```ts
import { Trigger, customEvent } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { db } from "./db.server";
import { z } from "zod";

new Trigger({
  id: "opened-issue-consumer",
  on: customEvent({
    name: "github.issue",
    filter: {
      action: ["opened"],
    }
    schema: z.object({ id: z.string() }),
  }),
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    // 3. Retrieve the event from the database
    const event = await db.get(ctx.id);

    // 4. Do something with the event
  },
}).listen();
```

As you can see above we filtered the event to only trigger when the action is `opened`. This is because we only want to do something when an issue is opened. We also used a schema to validate the event payload (which in this pattern is pretty simple).
