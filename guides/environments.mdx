When you create an Organization in Trigger.dev, we will automatically create two default environments for you: `live` and `development`, each with their own API key, which you can find in the Organization "API Keys" page:

![api keys page](https://imagedelivery.net/3TbraffuDZ4aEf8KWOmI_w/823f5667-de72-4662-edc2-d211118c2300/public)

You should use the `live` environment when running your workflows in production, and the `development` environment when running your workflows on your local machine. Each workflow "run" is associated with a specific environment, so a run in the `live` environment will not be visible in the `development` environment.

## Using API Keys

When you define your Trigger.dev workflows in code, you can pass in the relevant API Key to the constructor:

```ts
import { Trigger, customEvent } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { z } from "zod";

new Trigger({
  id: "basic-starter",
  name: "Basic Starter",
  apiKey: "trigger_development_qvq1uKLrWT7o",
  on: customEvent({
    name: "basic.starter",
    schema: z.object({ id: z.string() }),
  }),
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    // Do something with the event here
  },
}).listen();
```

If you were to run the code above, the workflow would be registerd in your organization and ready to use in the `development` environment.

<Warning>
  Please do not hardcode your API keys in your code, instead use an environment
  variable.
</Warning>

We will automatically use the `TRIGGER_API_KEY` environment variable to set the API key for your workflow, if it is present. For a good guide on defining and using environment variables in Node.js, please see [this article published by the Twilio team](https://www.twilio.com/blog/working-with-environment-variables-in-node-js-html)

## Environments and Triggers

Different triggers behave differently when it comes to environments and API keys:

### Webhooks

When an event comes from a webhook, both the `live` and `development` environments will trigger workflow runs. This is because the webhook is not associated with a specific environment, and we don't have to register two different webhooks for each webhook triggered workflow.

### Custom events

When you have a workflow that is triggered via a custom event, then only the environment associated with that event will be run. For example, if you have a workflow that is triggered by a custom event called `basic.starter`:

```ts
import { Trigger, customEvent } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { z } from "zod";

new Trigger({
  id: "basic-starter",
  name: "Basic Starter",
  on: customEvent({
    name: "basic.starter",
    schema: z.object({ id: z.string() }),
  }),
  async run(event, ctx) {
    await ctx.logger.info("Hello world from inside trigger.dev");
  },
}).listen();
```

And you send this custom event using the `@trigger.dev/sdk` in some other place in your code:

```ts
import { sendEvent } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { randomUUID } from "node:crypto";

// Send a custom event to the "basic.starter" workflow
// This will only trigger the workflow corresponding to the TRIGGER_API_KEY environment variable
await sendEvent(randomUUID(), {
  name: "basic.starter",
  payload: { id: "user_1234" },
});
```

`sendEvent` automatically uses the `TRIGGER_API_KEY` environment variable to determine which environment to send the event to. So if the `trigger_development_*` API Key is used, then the event will be sent to the `development` environment, and if the `trigger_live_*` API Key is used, then the event will be sent to the `live` environment.

You can see this in action here in [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), using our [sendEvent](/api-reference/events/sendEvent) API endpoint, where we include the API Key as the bearer token:

### Scheduled

Scheduled events are disabled in the `development` environment by default, since you will rarely actually want to run a scheduled event in development. You can enable scheduled events in the `development` environment by clicking the "Enable" button in the Workflow sidebar:

## Changing Environments

In the Trigger.dev dashboard, you can switch between environments using the dropdown in the side bar:

![changing envs](/images/switch-environments.gif)

The currently selected environment is per-workflow, so you can have different workflows selected in different environments.

## Detecting the environment of a run

You can detect which environment a run is associated with by using the `context.environment` property in your workflow code:

```ts
import { Trigger, customEvent } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { z } from "zod";

new Trigger({
  id: "basic-starter",
  name: "Basic Starter",
  apiKey: "trigger_development_qvq1uKLrWT7o",
  on: customEvent({
    name: "basic.starter",
    schema: z.object({ id: z.string() }),
  }),
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    if (ctx.environment === "live") {
      await ctx.logger.info("This is the live environment");
    } else {
      await ctx.logger.info("This is the development environment");
    }
  },
}).listen();
```
