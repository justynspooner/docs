If you don't currently have a long-running Node.js process to host your Trigger.dev functions, you can easily deploy them to [Render.com](https://render.com/) using this guide.

Render.com is a fully managed platform for hosting Node.js applications. It's easy to get started, and costs as little as $7/month for a Background Worker.

For this quickstart we have developed an [Example Repo](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/render-deploy-example) that is setup and ready to deploy to Render.com. You can [fork this repo](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/render-deploy-example/fork) into your own GitHub organization or user account and follow along with this guide.

### 1. Create a Render.com account

If you don't already have a Render.com account, you can [sign up for a free account](https://dashboard.render.com/register) and get started.

### 2. Create a new Background Worker service

Because Trigger.dev functions are long-running Node.js processes, we'll use Render's Background Worker service to host them. On the "Create a new Background Worker" page, connect your GitHub account and give Render.com access to the repo forked above:

![Create a new Background Worker service](/images/render/create-new-background-worker.png)

Install the Render.com GitHub app on the repo you just forked (this is me installing the app on my fork of the example repo):

![Install the Render.com GitHub app](/images/render/github-connect.png)

You'll be redirected back to Render.com, where you should now see the repository you just forked and a "Connect" button. Click it.

### 3. Configure the Background Worker

Give your Background Worker service a name and then scroll down to the "Build Command" field. Enter the following command:

![Connect the repo](/images/render/build-command.png)

Select the **Starter** instance type, and then expand the **Advanced** section and add an environment key called `TRIGGER_API_KEY` with your Trigger.dev API key as the value.

![Add the TRIGGER_API_KEY environment variable](/images/render/env-var.png)

As a reminder, you can find your Trigger.dev API key in the [Trigger.dev dashboard](https://app.trigger.dev):

![Get the live API key from the Trigger.dev dashboard](/images/render/live-key.png)

### 4. Deploy and Test

Click the "Create Background Worker" button to deploy your Trigger.dev functions to Render.com. Once the deployment is complete, you should see a log message showing that your Trigger.dev function is running and waiting for events:

![Deploy and test](/images/render/deploy-logs.png)

Head over to your Trigger.dev dashboard and you should see the Workflow you created:

![New Workflow](/images/render/new-workflow.png)

<Note>
  Make sure you have selected the "Live" environment for this next part, as we
  used your Live API key above in the tutorial
</Note>

Click the "Test" button to send a test event to your Trigger.dev function:

![Test event](/images/render/test-event.png)

Then head over to your Background Worker logs in Render.com and you should see a log message showing that the event was received:

![Test event](/images/render/test-render-log.png)

And finally you should see the run in your Trigger.dev dashboard:

![Test event](/images/render/test-run-log.png)

And that's it! You've successfully deployed your Trigger.dev functions to Render.com.
