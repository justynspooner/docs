Webhooks are a crucial part of API development, allowing for real-time reactions to various events across different systems, such as when a Stripe Payment is made, or when a GitHub issue is created.

## Advantages of using Trigger.dev for webhooks

Webhooks can be difficult to work with, especially when developing locally. We make them far easier to use with our [integrations](/integrations/apis).

- You don't need to register/unregister for webhooks, we do it for you
- They work locally during development without needing to use tunnels (e.g. Ngrok)
- We receive the webhook, then keep trying to send it to you until you receive it. If your server goes down, no problem.

## Usage

There are two ways to use webhooks with Trigger.dev:

1. Use one of our built-in integrations, such as [GitHub](/integrations/github). We'll take care of registering the webhook for you.
2. Use our [webhookEvent](/reference/webhook-event) function to create a webhook subscription and you'll register the webhook yourself.

## Webhook integrations

We currently have built in integrations for the following webhooks:

- [GitHub](/integrations/apis/github)

Please [join our discord community](https://discord.gg/kA47vcd8P6) and let us know which integration you'd like us to add.

We've documented all the support webhooks for each integration in the sidebar, for example the GitHub [newStarEvent](/integrations/apis/github/events/new-star) webhook:

```ts
import * as github from "@trigger.dev/github";

new Trigger({
  id: "demo",
  on: github.events.newStarEvent({
    repo: "triggerdotdev/trigger.dev",
  }),
  run: async (event, ctx) => {},
}).listen();
```

Once you've connected to Trigger.dev, and authorized your GitHub account, we'll go ahead and register the webhook in the repository you've specified and start triggering your `Trigger.run` function when new stars roll in.

## Manual Webhooks

If we haven't built out the integration you need, you can use our `webhookEvent` function to create a webhook subscription. You'll need to register the webhook yourself, but we'll take care of the rest. Here's an example for triggering events when a new booking happens in [Cal.com](https://cal.com):

```ts
import { Trigger, webhookEvent } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { z } from "zod";

new Trigger({
  id: "caldotcom-to-slack",
  name: "Cal.com To Slack",
  on: webhookEvent({
    service: "cal.com",
    eventName: "BOOKING_CREATED",
    filter: {
      triggerEvent: ["BOOKING_CREATED"],
    },
    schema: z.any(),
    verifyPayload: {
      enabled: true,
      header: "X-Cal-Signature-256",
    },
  }),
  run: async (event, ctx) => {},
}).listen();
```

For more information on the various options for `webhookEvent`, see the [webhookEvent reference](/reference/webhook-event).

Once you connect to Trigger.dev, we will display the URL and (optionally) the secret you need to register with the webhook provider on the workflow overview page:

![Webhook URL](/images/webhook-url.png)

Copy the URL and secret, and register the webhook with the provider (in this case, Cal.com). Once you've done that, we'll start triggering your `Trigger.run` function when the webhook fires.

## Examples

```ts Github
import { Trigger } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import * as github from "@trigger.dev/github";
import * as slack from "@trigger.dev/slack";

new Trigger({
  id: "escalate-critical-issues",
  name: "Posts to Slack when GitHub Issue created or modified",
  apiKey: "<my_api_key>",
  //this is the webhook subscription
  on: github.events.issueEvent({
    repo: "my-github-org/my-github-repo",
  }),
  //this function is run when the webhook fires
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    if (event.action === "labeled") {
      await ctx.logger.info(
        `The issue ${event.issue.title} was labeled ${event.label.name}`
      );

      if (event.label.name === "critical") {
        await slack.postMessage("send-to-slack", {
          channel: "serious-issues",
          text: `Critical issue: ${event.issue.title} was labeled ${event.label.name}`,
        });
      }
    }

    return event;
  },
}).listen();
```
