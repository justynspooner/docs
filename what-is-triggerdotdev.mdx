Trigger.dev is a platform and an SDK for building and running workflows in your codebase, triggered by various sources, but without having to worry about managing any complicated orchestration infrastructure.

## What we take care of for you:

- We provide a an orchestration platform for running workflows in your codebase.
- We provide an SDK for building workflows in your codebase, triggered by various sources such as [custom events](/triggers/custom-events), [scheduled events](/triggers/scheduled-events), and [webhooks](/triggers/webhooks).
- We provide out-of-the-box integrations with popular services such as [Slack](/integrations/apis/slack), [GitHub](/integrations/apis/github) and [more](/integrations), which vastly simplifies the process interacting with 3rd-party services.
- We provide a nice UI for viewing and debugging your workflows.

## What you take care of:

- You write your workflows in your codebase.
- You deploy your codebase to a long-running Node.js server.

## How it works

To get an idea of how Trigger.dev works, let's take a look at a simple workflow that sends a Slack message when a GitHub issue is labelled as `critical`:

![Test a run](/images/workflow-demo.gif)

The code on the left is running in a long-running Node.js server, managed by you. It is listening for the [issueEvent](/integrations/apis/github/events/issues) GitHub webhook, and when it receives one, we will take care of calling the `run` function supplied to the `Trigger` constructor with the webhook payload. This gives you the following advantages over traditional webhooks:

- When working locally, you don't need to expose your local server to the internet over a tunnel like ngrok.
- We will automatically register the webhook with GitHub for you, and verify the payload signature.
- We provide a nicely typed `event` payload to your `run` function, so you don't have to setup webhook payload types.
- If your server isn't running, we will wait until it's back online before attempting to run the workflow.
- It is very easy to test your workflow locally using our [Test Run](/guides/running-tests) feature.

As you can see the above workflow also makes a call to our Slack [postMessage](/integrations/apis/slack/actions/post-message) function, which provides the following advantages over using the raw Slack API:

- We automatically handle the OAuth flow for you, so you don't have to worry about setting up a Slack app and dealing with credentials in your code (see our [Authentication](/guides/authentication) guide for more details).
- We let you pass the `channelName` parameter to the `postMessage` function, and we will automatically resolve it to the channel ID for you (which is required by the Slack API).
- We will automatically invite the bot to the channel if it isn't already a member.
- We will automatically retry the request if the Slack API returns a rate limit error.
- We provide a nicely typed `response` object to your `postMessage` function, so you don't have to setup Slack API types.

## Why use Trigger.dev?

Apart from the reasons mentioned above, there are a few other reasons why you might want to use Trigger.dev:

- You want to access your database or other internal services from your workflows, without having to expose them to the internet.
- You want to colocate your workflows with your code, so you can deploy them together in one atomic unit.
- You want to build event-driven architectures without having to manage any complicated orchestration infrastructure.
- You want to add in delays or retries to your workflows, without having to worry about managing a queue.

## Limitations

There are a few limitations to be aware of:

- We currently only support deploying to long-running Node.js servers, but we plan on adding support for serverless (e.g. AWS Lambda, Next.js and Vercel) and other languages in the future.
- Our integrations are currently quite limited, but we are trying to add more as fast as we can. If you have any suggestions, please let us know in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/kA47vcd8P6)!
- We don't offer any kind of self-hosting option at the moment, but we plan on adding this in the future as well as various hybrid options for deploying to your own cloud.

## Architecture

Below is a simplified architecture diagram of how Trigger.dev works:

![Architecture](/images/architecture.png)

As you can see above, we communicate between your `Trigger` code and the Trigger.dev platform using a WebSocket connection. This allows us to send events to your code, and receive tasks from your code.

We make use of [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/), an open-source distributed message broker, to ensure messages are delivered reliably and in order. And we host our Pulsar Cluster using [StreamNative.io](https://streamnative.io/).

Our WebSocket servers and the Trigger.dev service are hosted on AWS courtesy of [flightcontrol.dev](https://flightcontrol.dev).
