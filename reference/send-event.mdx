sidebarTitle: "sendEvent"
description: "Send a custom event to Trigger, from inside or outside of a workflow."
---

## Usage

```ts
import { Trigger, customEvent } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";

new Trigger({
  id: "usage",
  name: "usage",
  on: customEvent({
    name: "user.created",
    schema: z.any(),
  }),
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    await ctx.sendEvent("Sending context user.created event", {
      name: "user.created",
      payload: {
        id: "1234_abc",
      },
    });
  },
}).listen();
```

You can also use `sendEvent` by importing it from `@trigger.dev/sdk`:

```ts
import { sendEvent } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";

await sendEvent("Sending context user.created event", {
  name: "user.created",
  payload: {
    id: "1234_abc",
  },
});
```

<Note>
  If calling `sendEvent` from outside of a workflow run, it will make an HTTP
  API request to app.trigger.dev to send the event. Make sure you set the
  `TRIGGER_API_KEY` environment variable if you will be using it this way.
</Note>

## Parameters

<ParamField path="key" type="string" required={true}>
  A unique key for the event in the context of a workflow run. Please see the
  [Keys and Resumability](/guides/resumability) guide for more info.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="event" type="object" required={true}>
  <Expandable title="properties" defaultOpen={true}>
    <ParamField path="id" type="string" required={false}>
      An optional unique ID for the event. If not provided, one will be
      generated automatically (using `clid`). Set this field to perform event
      deduplication.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="name" type="string" required={true}>
      The name of the event. This is the name you set when creating the
      `customEvent` trigger.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="payload" type="json object" required={true}>
      The payload of the event.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="timestamp" type="ISO8601 string" required={false}>
      An optional timestamp for the event. If not provided, one will be generated. Must be in ISO 8601 format (e.g. `new Date().toISOString()`)
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="context" type="json object" required={false}>
      An optional context object for the event. This can be used to pass
      additional information about the event, such as the user who triggered
      it. Note that this is not currently exposed to the workflow (coming soon).
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="delay" type="object" required={false}>
      An optional delay object for the event. This can be used to delay the
      event by a certain amount of time. Use one of the following options:

      - `{ seconds: number }` - delay the event by a certain number of seconds
      - `{ minutes: number }` - delay the event by a certain number of minutes
      - `{ hours: number }` - delay the event by a certain number of hours
      - `{ days: number }` - delay the event by a certain number of days
      - `{ until: Date }` - delay the event until a certain date

      See the [Delaying Event Delivery](/functions/send-event#delaying-event-delivery) docs for more info.
