## Feb 28 2023 Release

We have added a Notion integration with support for all of their API endpoints.

#### @trigger.dev/notion - v0.1.24

The Notion SDK allows you to create, update and delete pages, databases and the content inside them. It also allows you to search and add comments.

Everything you can do using the Notion API is now possible using Trigger.dev.

## Feb 27 2023 Release

#### app.trigger.dev

We've retooled our [Templates](https://app.trigger.dev/templates) system to make it easier to get started with the new [create-trigger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-trigger) CLI:

![create-trigger demo](/images/create-trigger-demo.gif)

We've also added a few more templates:

- [GitHub Issues to Slack](https://app.trigger.dev/templates/github-issues-to-slack) - Get notified anytime your repo gets a issue
- [Scheduled Healthcheck](https://app.trigger.dev/templates/scheduled-healthcheck) - Run a scheduled healthcheck on your website every 5 minutes
- And more coming soon!

#### @trigger.dev/sdk - v0.2.18

- Make the schema an optional param for customEvent and webhookEvent
- Give a better error message when the API key is invalid
- Added a more helpful error message when missing an API key
- Added handly links to the dashboard in log feedback
- Log out when a run first starts as well
- Fixed an issue where using `sendEvent` outside of a run wouldn't use the first param as the event `id`

#### create-trigger - v0.2.0

Initial release of the [create-trigger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-trigger) CLI. This makes it easy to get started with Trigger.dev workflows using our templates.

## Feb 21 2023 Release

#### integrations.trigger.dev

We launched a new integrations system that makes it far easier for us to add new integrations to Trigger.dev. You can expect us to add integrations far faster from now on.

At the same time we added two new integrations:

#### @trigger.dev/sendgrid - v0.1.22

Send emails and add users to lists. If you use SendGrid and there are other API endpoints you need then definitely <a href="mailto:help@trigger.dev">let us know</a>.

#### @trigger.dev/airtable - v0.1.22

We have support for all of the Airtable record related REST API endpoints

- Create a record
- Get a record
- Update a record
- Update multiple records
- Delete a record
- Delete multiple records
- List records

We will be adding webhook support soon so you can build complex workflows that react to changes in Airtable. If there are other API endpoints you need that we don't currently support then please <a href="mailto:help@trigger.dev">let us know</a>.

## Feb 17 2023 Release

#### app.trigger.dev

We've launched a [templates system](https://app.trigger.dev/templates) that makes it far easier to get started with a new workflow and deploy it. You can choose from a list of templates, clone them into your GitHub organization and then easily run them locally or deploy them to Render.

![CleanShot 2023-02-17 at 14 18 43](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/534/219680224-df8f578a-a986-4479-b2c9-4a6b4a8750dd.png)

Initially we have three templates:

- [Basic Starter](https://app.trigger.dev/templates/basic-starter) - This repo is a very simple starting point for creating your Trigger.dev workflows.
- [GitHub Stars to Slack](https://app.trigger.dev/templates/github-stars-to-slack) - Get notified anytime your repo gets a new ⭐️
- [Resend Welcome Drip Campaign](https://app.trigger.dev/templates/resend-welcome-drip-campaign) - Easily setup a customized welcome email drip campaign when a new user signs up for your service.

It's _ridiculously easy_ to deploy to [Render.com](https://render.com) from one of these templates.
