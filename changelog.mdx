## Feb 17 2023 Release

#### app.trigger.dev

We've launched a [templates system](https://app.trigger.dev/templates) that makes it far easier to get started with a new workflow and deploy it. You can choose from a list of templates, clone them into your GitHub organization and then easily run them locally or deploy them to Render.

![CleanShot 2023-02-17 at 14 18 43](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/534/219680224-df8f578a-a986-4479-b2c9-4a6b4a8750dd.png)

Initially we have three templates:

- [Basic Starter](https://app.trigger.dev/templates/basic-starter) - This repo is a very simple starting point for creating your Trigger.dev workflows.
- [GitHub Stars to Slack](https://app.trigger.dev/templates/github-stars-to-slack) - Get notified anytime your repo gets a new ⭐️
- [Resend Welcome Drip Campaign](https://app.trigger.dev/templates/resend-welcome-drip-campaign) - Easily setup a customized welcome email drip campaign when a new user signs up for your service.

It's _ridiculously easy_ to deploy to [Render.com](https://render.com) from one of these templates.
