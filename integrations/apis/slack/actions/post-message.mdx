Publish Slack messages to a public or private channel in your Slack Workspace as the Trigger.dev Slack bot. If you need to publish messages to your customer's Slack channels, consider using [Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) and our [fetch](/functions/fetch) function.

## Params

<ParamField path="key" type="string" required={true}>
  A unique string. Please see the [Keys and Resumability](/guides/resumability)
  doc for more info.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="message" type="object" required={true}>
  <Expandable title="properties" defaultOpen={true}>
    <ParamField path="channelName" type="string" required={false}>
      The name of the channel, can optionally include the `#`. E.g. `#team`.
      Alternatively you can use the `channelId` param.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="channelId" type="string" required={false}>
      The slack ID of the channel, e.g. `C04GWUTDC4W`. Can be used instead of `channelName`. Use `channelId` if the slack channel name could change.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="text" type="string" required={true}>
      The formatted text of the message to be published, formatted as [mrkdwn](https://api.slack.com/reference/surfaces/formatting#basics).
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="blocks" type="object" required={false}>
      You can use blocks to create a rich message with images, buttons, and more.

      You can either pass in a JavaScript object or use [JSX Slack](https://github.com/yhatt/jsx-slack/) to create blocks. We highly recommend using JSX Slack as it's much easier to read and write. See the [block example](#blocks-with-interactivity) to see it in action.

      For full details on Slack blocks, see the [Slack API docs](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks).
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="thread_ts" type="string" required={false}>
      The "timestamp ID" of the message to reply to. If not specified, the
      message will be published as a new thread.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="metadata" type="object" required={false}>
      A JSON object that will be attached to the message. This can be used to
      store custom data about the message, but will not be displayed to users. Useful for passing data to a [blockActionInteraction](../events/block-action-interaction) trigger.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="username" type="string" required={false}>
      The name of the bot that will publish the message. If not specified, the
      message will be published as the Trigger.dev Slack bot.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="icon_emoji" type="string" required={false}>
      The emoji to use as the icon for the bot that will publish the message.
      If not specified, the message will be published as the Trigger.dev Slack
      bot.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="icon_url" type="string" required={false}>
      The URL of an image to use as the icon for the bot that will publish the
      message. If not specified, the message will be published as the
      Trigger.dev Slack bot.
    </ParamField>

  </Expandable>
</ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseField name="ok" type="boolean" default="true">
  Always true; non-ok responses will halt the workflow run and throw an error.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="channel" type="string">
  The channel ID of the channel the message was published to.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="ts" type="string">
  The "timestamp ID" of the message, which can be used to update or delete the

## Example Workflows

### Notify Slack on New GitHub Star

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Notify Slack on New GitHub Star
import * as github from "@trigger.dev/github";
import * as slack from "@trigger.dev/slack";

new Trigger({
  id: "new-star",
  name: "On New Star",
  on: github.events.newStarEvent({
    repo: "triggerdotdev/trigger.dev",
  }),
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    await slack.postMessage("‚≠êÔ∏è New Star", {
      channelName: "github-stars",
      text: `Repo ${event.repository.full_name} got a star from ${event.sender.login}, for a total of ${event.repository.stargazers_count} stars!`,
    });
  },
}).listen();
```

```json Example response
{
  "ok": true,
  "ts": "1673618429.084699",
  "channel": "C04GWUTDC3W",
  "message": {

    "user": "U04JTTQ08SF",
    "bot_id": "B04JR3DCB4M"
  }
}
```

### Blocks with interactivity

You can add interaction and richer visual elements using Blocks. The easiest way to add them is using `jsx-slack` (which is a separate npm package that you can install).

This example messages your team every minute (!) and asks them how they're doing. There are two buttons and a dropdown menu.

In this examples there are two workflows:

1. Messages your team every minute (!) and asks them how they're doing.
2. Receives the interaction from users. It adds reactions when the buttons are pressed and posts a message when a user selects from the dropdown menu.

Please note, that to use `jsx-slack` you will need to add the `jsxImportSource` pragma to the top of your file. This is because `jsx-slack` is not a React library, but it uses the same syntax as React. Also, you might need to add `"jsx": "react-jsx"` to your `compilerOption` in `tsconfig.json`. The workflow file needs to be a `.jsx` or `.tsx` file (like when you use React).
