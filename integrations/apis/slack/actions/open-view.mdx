Open a modal view for a user after a button click or other user action. The view is a modal that blocks other user interactions with your app, and can be used to collect more complex input from users.

To be able to open a view, you must first acquire a `trigger_id` from a user interaction, such as a button click. See the [blockActionInteraction docs](../events/block-action-interaction) for more info on triggering on user actions.

<Note>
  `trigger_id`'s are valid for only 3 seconds, so make sure not to add any
  delays before calling `openView`
</Note>

## Usage

There are 3 steps to opening a view:

1. Post a message to a channel with an interactive component (button, select menu, etc).
2. Listen for a user interaction with that component (using [blockActionInteraction](../events/block-action-interaction)).
3. Call `openView` with the `trigger_id` from the interaction.

<CodeGroup>

```ts step1.ts
// This is inside a Trigger.run handler, but extracted for brevity
await slack.postMessage("New Issue", {
  channelName: "github-issues",
  text: "There is a new GitHub issue in the repo",
  metadata: { githubIssueId },
  blocks: [
    {
      type: "actions",
      block_id: "new.issue", // this is the block_id that we'll use to identify the message
      elements: [
        {
          type: "button",
          action_id: "reply",
          text: {
            type: "plain_text",
            text: "Reply to Issue",
          },
          value: "reply",
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

```ts step2.ts
new Trigger({
  id: "github-issue-slack-interaction",
  name: "GitHub Issue Slack Interaction",
  on: slack.events.blockActionInteraction({
    blockId: "new.issue",
  }),
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    // Use the trigger_id from the event to open the view
  },
}).listen();
```

```ts step3.ts
new Trigger({
  id: "github-issue-slack-interaction",
  name: "GitHub Issue Slack Interaction",
  on: slack.events.blockActionInteraction({
    blockId: "new.issue",
  }),
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    await slack.openView("Get the reply", event.trigger_id, {
      type: "modal",
      callback_id: "reply",
      title: {
        type: "plain_text",
        text: "Reply to Issue",
      },
      blocks: [
        {
          type: "input",
          block_id: "replyInput",
          element: {
            type: "plain_text_input",
            action_id: "reply",
          },
          label: {
            type: "plain_text",
            text: "Reply",
          },
        },
      ],
      submit: {
        type: "plain_text",
        text: "Submit",
      },
    });
  },
}).listen();
```

</CodeGroup>

## Modal Validation

You can optional provide a validation schema (using [Zod](/guides/zod)) which we will use to validate the view submission and provide feedback to the user.

For example, we could make sure the `replyInput` above is more than 3 characters and less than 500 characters:

```ts
await slack.openView(
  "Get the reply",
  event.trigger_id,
  {
    type: "modal",
    callback_id: "reply",
    title: {
      type: "plain_text",
      text: "Reply to Issue",
    },
    blocks: [
      {
        type: "input",
        block_id: "replyInput",
        element: {
          type: "plain_text_input",
          action_id: "reply",
        },
        label: {
          type: "plain_text",
          text: "Reply",
        },
      },
    ],
    submit: {
      type: "plain_text",
      text: "Submit",
    },
  },
  {
    validationSchema: z.object({
      replyInput: z.string().min(3).max(500),
    }),
  }
);
```

Note that the `block_id` of the input is used as the key in the validation schema (not the `action_id`).

The above example will show an error message if the user submits a reply that is less than 3 characters or more than 500 characters, but you might want to provide an even better experience by using the built-in validation provided by BlockKit:

```ts
await slack.openView("Get the reply", event.trigger_id, {
  type: "modal",
  callback_id: "reply",
  title: {
    type: "plain_text",
    text: "Reply to Issue",
  },
  blocks: [
    {
      type: "input",
      block_id: "replyInput",
      element: {
        type: "plain_text_input",
        action_id: "reply",
      },
      label: {
        type: "plain_text",
        text: "Reply",
      },
      min_length: 3,
      max_length: 500,
    },
  ],
  submit: {
    type: "plain_text",
    text: "Submit",
  },
});
```

See Slack's [Block Element reference docs](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements) page for more information the properties you can use to control a user's input.

## JSX Slack

You can use the [JSX Slack](https://github.com/yhatt/jsx-slack/) project to build your views in a more declarative way:

### Step 1: Install and configure JSX Slack

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">

```bash
npm install jsx-slack
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm add jsx-slack
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="yarn">

```bash
yarn add jsx-slack
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

If you aren't already using React in your project, you will need to update your `tsconfig.json` file to add the `compilerOptions.jsx` option, and ensure to include `.tsx` files in your `include` array:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react-jsx"
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*.ts", "src/**/*.tsx"]
}
```

### Step 2: Create your Modal

```tsx modals.tsx
/** @jsxImportSource jsx-slack */
import JSXSlack, {
  Actions,
  Input,
  Textarea,
  Section,
  Header,
  Modal,
} from "jsx-slack";

export function replyModal(title: string, callbackId: string) {
  return JSXSlack(
    <Modal title="Your reply" close="Cancel" callbackId={callbackId}>
      <Header>Issue title</Header>
      <Section>{title}</Section>
      <Header>Your reply</Header>
      <Textarea
        name="message"
        label="Message"
        placeholder="Your message"
        maxLength={500}
        id="messageInput"
      />
      <Input type="submit" value="submit" />
    </Modal>
  );
}
```

### Step 3: Open the Modal

```ts
import { replyModal } from "./modals";

await slack.openView(
  "Get the reply",
  event.trigger_id,
  replyModal("Issue title", "reply")
);
```

## Handling a View Submission

To get the results of a view submission, you can use the [viewSubmissionInteraction](../events/view-submission-interaction) event, providing the `callback_id` of the view you want to listen for:

```ts
new Trigger({
  id: "handle-view-submission",
  name: "Handle View Submission",
  on: slack.events.viewSubmissionInteraction({
    callbackId: "reply",
  }),
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    // use event.view.state.values to get the values of the inputs
  },
}).listen();
```

For more information please see the [viewSubmissionInteraction docs](../events/view-submission-interaction).

## Passing custom data

There are a few ways you can pass custom data to your view submission handler when opening a view:

### Using the `metadata` option

When calling `openView`, you can pass a 4th argument which is object with a `metadata` property. This will be passed to your view submission handler as `event.view.private_metadata`:

<CodeGroup>

```ts openView.ts
import { replyModal } from "./modals";

await slack.openView(
  "Get the reply",
  event.trigger_id,
  replyModal("Issue title", "reply"),
  {
    metadata: {
      issueId: "123",
      thread_ts: event.message.ts,
    },
  }
);
```

```ts viewSubmissionInteraction.ts
new Trigger({
  id: "handle-view-submission",
  name: "Handle View Submission",
  on: slack.events.viewSubmissionInteraction({
    callbackId: "reply",
  }),
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    // event.view.private_metadata will be:
    // {
    //   issueId: "123",
    //   thread_ts: "123.456"
    // }
    //
    // use event.view.private_metadata.thread_ts to post a reply to a message in a thread
    await slack.postMessage("Reply", {
      channelName: "github-issues",
      text: event.view.state.values.messageInput.message.value,
      thread_ts: event.view.private_metadata.thread_ts,
    });
  },
}).listen();
```
