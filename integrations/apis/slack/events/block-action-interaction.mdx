---

## Overview

If you send a message with BlockKit components, you can trigger a workflow when a user interacts with those components. For example, you can trigger a workflow when a user clicks a button, selects an option from a menu, or submits a modal.

The event will be the [block_action event payload](https://api.slack.com/reference/interaction-payloads/block-actions#fields) from Slack, which includes the `actions` array. You can use the `actions` array to determine which action was triggered, and the `block_id` and `action_id` to determine which component was interacted with.

A very simple example would be to first send a message to a channel with a button, and then trigger a workflow when the button is clicked:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Send Message with Button
import * as slack from "@trigger.dev/slack";
import { z } from "zod";

const BLOCK_ID = "employee-ping";

new Trigger({
  id: "send-message-with-button",
  name: "Send Message with Button",
  on: scheduleEvent({
    rateOf: {
      minutes: 5,
    },
  }),
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    await slack.postMessage("Are you still there?", {
      channelName: "employee-ping",
      //text appears in Slack notifications on mobile/desktop
      text: "Are you still there?",
      blocks: [
        {
          type: "section",
          text: {
            type: "mrkdwn",
            text: "Are you still there?",
            verbatim: true,
          },
        },
        {
          type: "actions",
          block_id: BLOCK_ID, // this is the block_id that we'll use to identify the message
          elements: [
            {
              type: "button",
              action_id: "nope",
              text: {
                type: "plain_text",
                text: "I'm at lunch",
                emoji: true,
              },
              value: "lunch",
            },
            {
              type: "button",
              action_id: "youbet",
              text: {
                type: "plain_text",
                text: "Still here!",
                emoji: true,
              },
              value: "in-my-seat",
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
    });
  },
}).listen();
```

```typescript Listen for Button Click
import * as slack from "@trigger.dev/slack";
import { z } from "zod";

const BLOCK_ID = "employee-ping";

new Trigger({
  id: "employee-ping-event",
  name: "Listen for Employee Ping",
  on: slack.events.blockActionInteraction({
    blockId: BLOCK_ID,
  }),
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    const action = event.actions[0];

    if (action.action_id === "nope") {
      await slack.postMessage("respond to employee", {
        channelName: "employee-ping",
        text: "Okay, I'll ping you again in 5 minutes.",
      });
    } else if (action.action_id === "youbet") {
      await slack.postMessage("respond to employee", {
        channelName: "employee-ping",
        text: "Great! I'll ping you again in 5 minutes.",
      });
    }
  },
}).listen();
```

## Passing custom data

There are three ways to pass custom data to the workflow that is triggered by the event:

1. Use the `value` field of the BlockKit component. This is the easiest way to pass data, but it is limited to 2000 characters.
2. Use the `metadata` option when sending the message. This is best for handling "context" data that relates to any possible action taken in a BlockKit message.

An example of using the `value` field:

<CodeGroup>

```ts postMessage.ts
await slack.postMessage("New Issue", {
  channelName: "github-issues",
  //text appears in Slack notifications on mobile/desktop
  text: "There is a new GitHub issue in the repo",
  blocks: [
    {
      type: "actions",
      block_id: "new.issue", // this is the block_id that we'll use to identify the message
      elements: [
        {
          type: "button",
          action_id: "reply",
          text: {
            type: "plain_text",
            text: "Reply to Issue",
          },
          value: githubIssueId,
        },
        {
          type: "button",
          action_id: "close",
          text: {
            type: "plain_text",
            text: "Close Issue",
          },
          value: githubIssueId,
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

```ts trigger.ts
new Trigger({
  id: "github-issue-slack-interaction",
  name: "GitHub Issue Slack Interaction",
  on: slack.events.blockActionInteraction({
    blockId: "new.issue",
  }),
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    const action = event.actions[0];

    if (action.action_id === "reply") {
      // action.value is the githubIssueId
    } else if (action.action_id === "close") {
      // action.value is the githubIssueId
    }
  },
}).listen();
```

</CodeGroup>

And an example using the `metadata` option (which can be any JSON-serializable data):

<CodeGroup>

```ts postMessage.ts
await slack.postMessage("New Issue", {
  channelName: "github-issues",
  //text appears in Slack notifications on mobile/desktop
  text: "There is a new GitHub issue in the repo",
  metadata: { githubIssueId },
  blocks: [
    {
      type: "actions",
      block_id: "new.issue", // this is the block_id that we'll use to identify the message
      elements: [
        {
          type: "button",
          action_id: "reply",
          text: {
            type: "plain_text",
            text: "Reply to Issue",
          },
          value: "reply",
        },
        {
          type: "button",
          action_id: "close",
          text: {
            type: "plain_text",
            text: "Close Issue",
          },
          value: "close",
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

```ts trigger.ts
new Trigger({
  id: "github-issue-slack-interaction",
  name: "GitHub Issue Slack Interaction",
  on: slack.events.blockActionInteraction({
    blockId: "new.issue",
  }),
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    const action = event.actions[0];

    if (action.action_id === "reply") {
      // event.message.metadata.event_payload.githubIssueId is the githubIssueId
    } else if (action.action_id === "close") {
      // event.message.metadata.event_payload.githubIssueId is the githubIssueId
    }
  },
}).listen();
```

</CodeGroup>

## JSX Slack

You can use the [JSX Slack](https://github.com/yhatt/jsx-slack/) project to build your BlockKit messages and trigger the `blockActionInteraction` event.

### Step 1: Install and configure JSX Slack

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">

```bash
npm install jsx-slack
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm add jsx-slack
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="yarn">

```bash
yarn add jsx-slack
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

If you aren't already using React in your project, you will need to update your `tsconfig.json` file to add the `compilerOptions.jsx` option, and ensure to include `.tsx` files in your `include` array:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react-jsx"
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*.ts", "src/**/*.tsx"]
}
```

### Step 2: Create your BlockKit message

```tsx
/** @jsxImportSource jsx-slack */
import JSXSlack, {
  Actions,
  Blocks,
  Button,
  Section,
  Select,
  Option,
} from "jsx-slack";

export function progressBlock(blockId: string) {
  return JSXSlack(
    <Blocks>
      <Section>How is your progress today?</Section>
      <Actions blockId={blockId}>
        <Button value="blocked" actionId="status-blocked">
          I'm blocked
        </Button>
        <Button
          value="help"
          actionId="status-help"
          url="https://xkcd.com/1349/"
        >
          Get help
        </Button>
        <Select actionId="rating" placeholder="Rate it!">
          <Option value="5">5 {":star:".repeat(5)}</Option>
          <Option value="4">4 {":star:".repeat(4)}</Option>
          <Option value="3">3 {":star:".repeat(3)}</Option>
          <Option value="2">2 {":star:".repeat(2)}</Option>
          <Option value="1">1 {":star:".repeat(1)}</Option>
        </Select>
      </Actions>
    </Blocks>
  );
}
```

Please note, that to use `jsx-slack` you will need to add the `jsxImportSource` pragma to the top of your file. This is because `jsx-slack` is not a React library, but it uses the same syntax as React. The file also needs to be a `.jsx` or `.tsx` file (like when you use React).

### Step 3: Use your BlockKit message in a `postMessage` call

<CodeGroup>

```typescript postMessage.ts
import * as slack from "@trigger.dev/slack";
import { z } from "zod";
import { progressBlock } from "./messages";

const BLOCK_ID = "issue.action.block";

//1. every minute see how your employees are doing, we don't recommend this frequency ðŸ˜‰
new Trigger({
  id: "slack-interactivity",
  name: "Testing Slack Interactivity",
  on: scheduleEvent({
    rateOf: {
      minutes: 1,
    },
  }),
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    await slack.postMessage("jsx-test", {
      channelName: "employee-progress",
      text: "How is your progress today?",
      blocks: progressBlock(BLOCK_ID), // Pass in the block_id which we'll trigger on in the next step
    });
  },
}).listen();
```

```typescript blockAction.ts
new Trigger({
  id: "slack-block-interaction",
  name: "Slack Block Interaction",
  on: slack.events.blockActionInteraction({
    blockId: BLOCK_ID, // trigger on the block_id we passed in the previous step
    actionId: ["status-blocked", "status-help", "rating"], // we could have also left this blank to trigger on all actions
  }),
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    if (!event.message) {
      return;
    }

    const action = event.actions[0];

    switch (action.action_id) {
      case "status-blocked": {
        return slack.addReaction("React to message", {
          name: "cry",
          timestamp: event.message.ts,
          channelId: event.channel.id,
        });
      }
      case "status-help": {
        return slack.addReaction("React to message", {
          name: "sos",
          timestamp: event.message.ts,
          channelId: event.channel.id,
        });
      }
      case "rating": {
        if (action.type != "static_select") {
          throw new Error("This action should be a select");
        }

        //post the rating as a message that appears below the original,
        //only the user pressing the button will see this message
        return slack.postMessageResponse(
          "Added a comment to the issue",
          event.response_url,
          {
            text: `You rated your day ${action.selected_option?.value} stars`,
            replace_original: false,
          }
        );
      }
    }
  },
}).listen();
```

</CodeGroup>
