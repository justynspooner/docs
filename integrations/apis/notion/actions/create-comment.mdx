There are two locations you can add a new comment to:

1. A page
2. An existing discussion thread

If the intention is to add a new comment to a page, a parent object must be provided in the body params. Alternatively, if a new comment is being added to an existing discussion thread, the discussion_id string must be provided in the body params. Exactly one of these parameters must be provided.
