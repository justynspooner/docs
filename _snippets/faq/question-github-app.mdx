## Why do we ask for GitHub access?

When using a [Template](https://app.trigger.dev/templates) we will take care of creating a new repository for you using our [GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/trigger-dev-app).

During the GitHub app installation process, you can choose which repositories you want to give us access to, and GitHub requires that you select at least 1. Unfortunately, there is no way around this requirement by GitHub, and it doesn't matter which repository you choose as we will create a new repository for you anyway.
